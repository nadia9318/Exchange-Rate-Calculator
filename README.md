# Exchange-Rate-Calculator
Created an exchange rate calculator to present the exchange rates of currencies in real time. This calculator is able to swap currencies to provide up to date data.

## Languages Used

<li>JavaScript</li>

## Project Breakdown
### HTML
Created the backbone of the project. There I created the dropdown select list of currencies and also the input boxes for the conversions for each option.

### CSS
Added the UI to the project which helped with the dropdown select lists. A media query was added too for responsiveness

### JavaScript
Here was where I fetched the exchange rate API to power the site and input the real time data. Event listeners were placed to calculate the inputs and changes to the options. And an event listener was used to swap currencies when needed.
